                  <h2>Primary Fur Color and Approaching</h2>
                  <hr>
                  <p>We totaled up the approach (=true) counts for the three squirrel fur colors (=gray, cinnamon, or black). 
                    Approach values were true/false. They were assigned on the basis of whether or not a squirrel approached
                    a human for food.
                  </p>
                  <br>

              </div>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h3>Analysis:</h3>
              <p>In order to quantify the approaches, we applied a conditional statement and summed up the true and false counts.
                After finding that only 127 squirrels approached humans for food, we decided to identify the squirrel color that approached most frequently.
                Gray squirrels approached humans the most. The gray squirrel approach count was at 89, cinnamon at 33, and black at 5. We also calculated 
                the approaches as a percentage based on total reports: Gray: 4.9%, Cinnamon: 12.1%, Black: 7.3%. Although gray squirrels were reported the most for
                their approaches, they were the least likely out of the three fur colors to approach humans for food. As a whole, across the three fur colors, only 5% of squirrels 
                approached humans.

                  <h2>Primary Fur Color and Indifference</h2>
                  <hr>
                  <p> We summed up the indifferent (=true) counts for the squirrel fur colors. Indifferent values were binary. The indifferent value classification was based on whether or not the
                    squirrel under consideration was indifferent to human presence or not.
                  </p>

              <br>
              <h3>Analysis: </h3>
                <p>To sum up the indifferent binary values, we created a counter in order to total the number of indifferent=true values. We applied a conditional statement (with a fur color parameter) to do this.
                The gray squirrel had the most number of indifferent counts, at 872. Cinnamon counts were at 121, and black at 27. We calculated indifference as a percentage: Gray: 48.8%, Cinnamon: 80.6%, Black: 39.7%.
                Although gray squirrels received the most indifference reports, cinnamon squirrels were the most likely to be indifferent to human presence. As a whole, 48% of the squirrels across all fur colors were reportedly indifferent.
