Project Proposal/Topic
----------------
 When we think of potential harm in New York City, we primarily think of other people and manmade objects. However, there is a variation of wildlife that also 
resides there as well. Looking at Central Park, specifically, several species of mammals, birds, and reptiles that also call the city their home. The members in our 
group are interested in one such mammal, the squirrel. Our project aims to take information gathered on the squirrels of Central Park and display the data 
meaningfully to help keep natives, visitors, and the squirrels safe . Factors such as geological location, age, and behavior will all determine the outcomes of our
visualizations as we look to inform the public with our data.
